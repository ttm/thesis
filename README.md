This is the repository for my doctorate Thesis entitled:
"Topological stability and textual differentiation in human
interaction networks: statistical analysis and linked data"

The final document is tese-rfabbri.pdf
For obtaining it from the source files, run:
  $ pdflatex USPSC-modelo-IFSC-DFA.tex
  $ pdftk A=USPSC-modelo-IFSC-DFA.pdf B=referencias___.pdf cat A1-104 B A119-end output tese-rfabbri.pdf

The ./referencias_.pdf document with the bibliography is obtained from ./notes/Referencias\ Renato\ Fabbri_.docx
(might need to add margins 3cm left on odd pages, 3cm right on even pages, and the page numbering)

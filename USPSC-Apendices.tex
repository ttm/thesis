	\chapter{Additional tables of the textual differences found in all networks}\label{ap:textd}
In the following tables the counting of differences of textual features among the analyzed networks
are shown.
	These results are auxiliary for the discussion on Section~\ref{sec:tresults}.

\chapter{Developments made in this research but not included elsewhere in this thesis}\label{ap:vot}
In this appendix are gathered developments relevant for the initial proposal of this research:
enabling the use of complex networks scientific knowledge by the participant of the social networks.
These developments are not included elsewhere in the thesis because we chose to present results
more closely related to physics in a simple fashion.
Furthermore, most of the following contributions have received dedicated documentation,
reason why we next only summarize and cite the documents when they are available.

\section{Continuous voting by approval and participation}
In finding the adequate way to prioritize proposals, the Brazilian social participation community agreed about the measurement of two indexes,
one of approval and one of participation. Both practice and literature
was constantly handled by the experts involved, and the formalization
of such model and metrics and is very simple and seems novel.
Also, the relevance of this development is strengthened by the use of these indexes by the
Brazilian General Secretariat of the Republic to raise and prioritize
proposals about public health care in open processes.
This was achieved by means of the Dialoga Brasil federal platform~\cite{dialoga}.
A short report on these indexes and their use is on~\cite{dialogaAlg}
	(co-authorship by Ricardo Poppi).

	\section{Visualization of static networks}
	In Sections~\ref{sec:versinus0} and~\ref{sec:versinus1} we addressed a visualization method of networks through animations.
	We also made many static network visualizations which were important for our research.
	Many of these were made by testing software and programming libraries.
	We next exemplify such efforts by probably the most important and time-consuming realizations.

	\subsection{Static email networks visualization using Networkx and Graphviz and a PHP web interface}\label{sec:autoRede}
	At the start of this research, we observed many networks derived from email lists
	by means of a web interface we wrote.
	In such web interface, which was accessed as a usual webpage through HTTP in a web browser, 
	the user could specify an email list, start and end messages and a window size (number of messages taken together to obtain the network).
	The interface then rendered graph visualizations and standard measures such as degree, strength, clustering coefficient, betweenness centrality, both as histograms and as mean and standard deviation.
	The software source code is available in~\cite{autoRede} and an example image is Figure~\ref{fig:autoRede}.

\section{Anthropological physics}
The study of complex systems can be undertaken as a physics endeavor,
specially if complex networks and statistics are into play. When the complex
system is constituted by people, intriguing questions arise from diverse field such as math, ethics, and sociology. The “anthropological physics”is an approach to these scenarios that enables scientific research while resolving ethical and moral issues by an open study of the self.
	It yields a transdisciplinary practice whose relevance emanate from anthropological
and physical matters, from human constituted systems and natural laws.
A sweet spot was found in recent civil, government and academic efforts~\cite{opa,ensaio}, and has been called anthropological physics. General characteristics are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Exposure of the researcher to the environment of interest, such as virtual social networks.
	\item Use of the annotations from the exposure, be them activity logs, friendship or interaction networks, textual contents, etc.
	\item Upon need, expansion of observations to encompass open datasets or data donated by partners.
	\item Observance of natural laws as they appear in network structures and natural language.
	\item All resources are kept as open and publicized as possible, including software, data, and writings.
\end{itemize}                                                                                                                                     
A short report the first insights regarding anthropological physics is on~\cite{anPhy}.

	\chapter{Linked Open Social Data for Scientific Benchmarking (diagrams)}\label{ap:losd}

	In this document we provide diagrams
	for the social protocols in the Linked Open Social Database:
	Facebook, Twitter, IRC, Email, ParticipaBR, Cidade Democrática and AA.
	Each social protocol diagram was broken in two, one presents the relations
	among main classes (blue nodes) and data types (orange nodes),
	the other presents metadata for the
	snapshots.
	Every class instance is related to the snapshot instance
	by the triple \textttt{class\_uri po:snapshot snapshot\_uri}.
	Such triples are omitted for simplicity.
	Due to the large number of relations, the rendering of diagrams are
	automatized and displays some overlaps.
	Even so, the images are useful for grasping what is in the current
	database and for conducting explorations.
	Edges in the diagrams have:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item green color if representing an OWL existential
			class restriction (all individuals from the class present at least one triple with
				    the property as predicate);
			    \item inverted nip if representing an OWL universal class
				    restriction (all individuals presenting triples with the
								property as predicate are from the class);
							\item full edges (non-dashed) if representing a functional property
								axiom (there is at most one triple with the property as the
											    predicate for each individual).
	\end{itemize}

	Furthermore, this document ends with two sets of tables, one with
	references for snapshot groups, such as wikipedia or
	contact links, 
	the other with 
	counts of
	triples, participants, edges/interactions/relations and characters.


	\section{Facebook data}
	Each Facebook snapshot is yield by either an user, from which the
	friends constitute a friendship network, or a group, which participants
	can yield friendship and interaction networks and posts information with
	text and some metadata.
	Further information is found on the following diagrams, the tables on
	the end of this document or in the main document of this
	article~\cite{losd}.

				    \section{Twitter data}
				    Each Twitter snapshot is yield by a hashtag.
				    Retweets (\textttt{po:retweetOf} are usually considered the interactions between users.
				    The database present also \textttt{po:replyTo} and \textttt{po:userMention}
				    which might be useful in understanding the networking.

								  \section{IRC data}
								  Each IRC snapshot is yield by an IRC channel.
								  IRC messages are either server messages (e.g. join and exit)
								  marked with \textttt{po:systemMessage true} and having an \textttt{po:impliedUser user\_uri},
								  or user messages, which yield interactions through \textttt{po:directedTo} and \textttt{po:mentions} properties.
								  Text messages without the user names are delivered through the \textttt{po:cleanText} property.
								  Further information is found on the following diagrams, the tables on
								  the end of this document or in the main document of this
								  article~\cite{losd}.

											      \section{Email data}
											      Each email snapshot is yield by an Email list.
											      Interactions are yield through \textttt{po:replyTo} relations
											      although \textttt{po:to} and \textttt{po:cc} might also be considered.
											      The email body is given by \textttt{po:text} relations while
											      \textttt{po:cleanText} links to text with lines removed where they are
											      trivially from previous messages or computer code.

															  \section{ParticipaBR data}
															  The ParticipaBR snapshot is yield by a data dump donated by the system
															  administrators of the federal portal of social participation ParticipaBR.
															  Articles can have parent articles (\textttt{po:parent}), be step of a
															  collection of articles (\textttt{po:stepOf}) and be a mediation of other
															  articles (\textttt{po:mediationOf}).
															  Interactions are yield by comments which are \textttt{po:replyTo} other
															  comments or which are made directly to an article.
															  This snapshot holds also friendship structures.
															  The language used is mainly Brazilian Portuguese, but English and
															  Spanish are also incident.
															  Due to the higher complexity of the diagram, an additional figure is
															  given rendered with another layout algorithm.
															  Further information is found on the following diagrams, the tables on
															  the end of this document or in the main document of this
															  article~\cite{losd}.

																					  \section{Cidade Democrática data}
																					  The Cidade Democrática snapshot is yield by a data dump donated by the system
																					  administrators of the civil society social participation portal Cidade
																					  Democrática.
																					  This snapshot holds a complex structure of both
																					  Topics/Inspirati-ons/Observatories/Supports/Competitions/Prizes
																					  and of State/City/Neighbor-hood/Place.
																					  The language used is mainly Brazilian Portuguese.
																					  Due to the higher complexity of the diagram, an additional figure is

\chapter{Developments made in this research but not included elsewhere in this thesis}\label{ap:vot}
In this appendix are gathered developments relevant for the initial proposal of this research:
enabling the use of complex networks scientific knowledge by the participant of the social networks.
These developments are not included elsewhere in the thesis because we chose to present results
more closely related to physics in a simple fashion.
Furthermore, most of the following contributions have received dedicated documentation,
reason why we next only summarize and cite the documents when they are available.

\section{Continuous voting by approval and participation}
In finding the adequate way to prioritize proposals, the Brazilian social participation community agreed about the measurement of two indexes,
one of approval and one of participation. Both practice and literature
was constantly handled by the experts involved, and the formalization
of such model and metrics and is very simple and seems novel.
Also, the relevance of this development is strengthened by the use of these indexes by the
Brazilian General Secretariat of the Republic to raise and prioritize
proposals about public health care in open processes.
This was achieved by means of the Dialoga Brasil federal platform~\cite{dialoga}.
A short report on these indexes and their use is on~\cite{dialogaAlg}
	(co-authorship by Ricardo Poppi).

	\section{Visualization of static networks}
	In Sections~\ref{sec:versinus0} and~\ref{sec:versinus1} we addressed a visualization method of networks through animations.
	We also made many static network visualizations which were important for our research.
	Many of these were made by testing software and programming libraries.
	We next exemplify such efforts by probably the most important and time-consuming realizations.

	\subsection{Static email networks visualization using Networkx and Graphviz and a PHP web interface}\label{sec:autoRede}
	At the start of this research, we observed many networks derived from email lists
	by means of a web interface we wrote.
	In such web interface, which was accessed as a usual webpage through HTTP in a web browser, 
	the user could specify an email list, start and end messages and a window size (number of messages taken together to obtain the network).
	The interface then rendered graph visualizations and standard measures such as degree, strength, clustering coefficient, betweenness centrality, both as histograms and as mean and standard deviation.
	In the node-link diagrams, measurements were mapped to height, width and color of nodes and to link characteristics.
	The software source code is available in~\cite{autoRede} and an example image is Figure~\ref{fig:autoRede}.

	\subsection{Static Facebook networks visualization using Gephi}\label{sec:gephi}
	Mainly in the years of 2013 and 2014, Facebook users retrieved their friendship networks through Netvizz software~\cite{netvizz}
	and donated them to our research.
	I also retrieved friendship and interaction networks from Facebook groups I was a member, also using Netvizz.
	These networks were used for information collection and diffusion (explained in Section~\ref{sec:colDif}),
	taking measurements and visualization.
	The visualizations were achieved almost exclusively through the Gephi software~\cite{gephi}
	and is included in this appendix for being used a number of times by fellow researchers and artists.
	The most useful layout algorithm was Force Atlas 2~\cite{fa2} and an example of these images is Figure~\ref{fig:gephi}.

	\subsection{Art by Pedro Paulo Rocha}\label{sec:ppr}
	The static images rendered for the visualization of networks were at time also used for artistic elaborations.
	Apart from other artistic incidences reported in this appendix (such as in Sections~\ref{sec:govArt} and~\ref{sec:soundSkull})
	we present in Figure~\ref{fig:ppr} an example art from Pedro Paulo Rocha.
	More of his work that is derived from our network visualizations are gathered in an image Gallery~\cite{pprGal}.

\section{Mega networks}\label{sec:megarrede}
The most usual social networking platform nowadays is Facebook.
In this platform, one cannot have more than 5000 friends.
To analyze larger friendship network social structure through Facebook,
we started merging the networks from distinct users.
From this procedure we obtained networks with tenths of thousands of participants
and even a few which reached the scale of hundreds of thousands.
Such practice started at AVLAB 6 in SESC Pompéia (directed by Daniel Gonzales Xavier)
and was further developed in a number of occasions by us and other researchers.
Figure~\ref{fig:megarrede} exemplifies one of such structures.

\section{Social structures live streaming (networks and language-related)}\label{sec:sss}
A strong trait I could observe with the cycles of information gathering and diffusion (see Section~\ref{sec:clDif})
is the timid appropriation of the social structures by their participants.
Some people are enchanted by the figures,
others by the concepts and by the perception of the social aspect of themselves,
sometimes called ``network being'' or `` I-network '' by interested parties during the broadcasts.
In these contexts, academic theories, such as the Network Actor Theory (Latour),
were rarely recalled directly, even by specialists.
The efficiency of the intuitive discourse to communicate about these interests is impressive.
The impulse to report the impressions resembles the urge to report dreams,
with glimpses of subtle and unconscious structures and sequential forgetfulness.
In this context, in order to spread about how our traces can be observed and taken advantage of,
we programmed screens of social structures streaming in HTML pages.
Only Twitter was used, and networks yield by retweets,vocabulary and hashtags were contemplated.
The screen could also display recent tweets, more occurring words, co-occurrences,
and other simple text information.
These screens were used e.g. in the Arena NET Mundial event
and in mobilizations such as the one identified with the \#ocupaGOV hashtag.
Figures~\ref{fig:telao1} and~\ref{fig:telao2} exemplify such interfaces.
They were updated live as tweets were sent by all Twitter users whose messages
contained the selected hashtags.
The source code is publicly available in~\cite{teloes}.

\section{Anthropological physics}
The study of complex systems can be undertaken as a physics endeavor,
specially if complex networks and statistics are into play. When the complex
system is constituted by people, intriguing questions arise from diverse field such as math, ethics, and sociology. The “anthropological physics”is an approach to these scenarios that enables scientific research while resolving ethical and moral issues by an open study of the self.
	It yields a transdisciplinary practice whose relevance emanate from anthropological
and physical matters, from human constituted systems and natural laws.
A sweet spot was found in recent civil, government and academic efforts~\cite{opa,ensaio}, and has been called anthropological physics. General characteristics are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Exposure of the researcher to the environment of interest, such as virtual social networks.
	\item Use of the annotations from the exposure, be them activity logs, friendship or interaction networks, textual contents, etc.
	\item Upon need, expansion of observations to encompass open datasets or data donated by partners.
	\item Observance of natural laws as they appear in network structures and natural language.
	\item All resources are kept as open and publicized as possible, including software, data, and writings.
\end{itemize}                                                                                                                                     
A short report the first insights regarding anthropological physics is on~\cite{anPhy}.
